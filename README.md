# PC Idler

There are 2 versions of this program, "MouseMovement_wTabSwitch.exe" and "MouseMovement.exe"

"MouseMovement.exe":
Moves the mouse in an interval of 40-60 seconds, making the computer register mouse movement.

"MouseMovement_wTabSwitch.exe":
Moves the mouse, but also uses the Alt+Tab function, making the computer register mouse movement and keyboard keys being pressed. If "MouseMovement.exe" isn't enough for what you're trying to use it for, try this version out.

*** Alt+tab is a shortcut to bring forward the last window, it does not type, nor does it leave any permanent changes. All it does is change the focus from one open app to another.
